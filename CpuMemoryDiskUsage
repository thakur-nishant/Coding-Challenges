"""
We have time series data for CPU, memory, and disk usage attached in a CSV-encoded text file.
We want to analyze the data to better understand what is happening so we can inform our users.
Write a program that will read in the full data, bucket each series into five minute intervals,
and calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation of the data points in each bucket for each series.
Your program should print out the calculated statistics for each bucket.
